    <name>Albrecht Durer's Diary of his Trip to the Netherlands: 1520-1521</name>
    <open>1</open>
    <description>
      <p>The German master artist Albrecht Dürer left art historians an unparalleled archival legacy with his detailed diary of his trip to the Netherlands in 1520-1521. This text is invaluable for documenting Dürer's encounter with the art and artists of the Netherlands, as well as his opinions on the growing religious tensions in northern Europe. Beyond this, however, Dürer’s meticulous journal offers a glimpse of a sixteenth-century international traveler's day-to-day experience, telling us of his quotidian purchases, sales and gifts of small sketches, and personal interactions large and small as he traveled between the great cities of the north.</p>
      <p>This map has been generated from entries for the first month of Dürer's journey recorded in Georges Marlier and Marnix Gijsen’s text Albrecht Dürer: Diary of His Journey to the Netherlands, 1520-1521. By encoding the text as an XML document where places, people, and artworks are marked as elements in a hierarchical tree of diary entries, Ph. D student Matthew Lincoln was able to create a machine-readable "index" of the diary. A computerized script (written in XSLT) was written to translate this document into a KML file to be displayed in Google Earth.</p>
      <p>All the placemarks on this map - places, people, and artworks - are timestamped, so that by adjusting the time slider in the Google Earth interface one may visualize Dürer's journey through space and time in a way not easily grasped by reading the diary text alone. By clicking on individual placemarks, you may read the specific diary entry from which that marker was derived, connecting you directly back to the primary source. Because this map is computer-generated, future additions and revisions to the digitized diary text can be automatically incorporated.</p>

All their service was of silver, and they had other splendid ornaments and very costly meats. All their wives also were there. And as I was being led to the table to company stood on both sides as if they were leading some great lord. And there were amongst them men of very high position, who all behaved most respectfully towards me with deep courtesy, and promised to do everything in their power agreeable to me that they knew of. And as I was sitting there in such honor the Syndic of Antwerp came, with two servants, and presented me with four cans of wine in the name of the Town Councillors of Antwerp, and they had bidden him say that they wished thereby to show their respect for me and to assure me of their good will. Wherefore I returned them my humble thanks and offered my humble service. After that came Master Peeter, the town-carpenter, and presented me with two cans of wine, with the offer of his willing services. So when we had spent a long and merry time together till late in the night, they accompanied us home with lanterns in great honor. And they begged me to be ever assured and confident of their good will, and promised that in whatever I did they would be all-helpful to me. So I thanked them and laid me down to sleep."</p>
